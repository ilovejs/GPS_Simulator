Problem
Our clients have assets such as vehicles, cranes, excavators that they want to track in real time.

For your technical test we would like you to do a vehicle tracking simulator and plotter.

* Task
We would like you to demonstrate your full stack understanding (Front end, Node, AWS). The main three components of the application are:

    Vehicle Tracker Simulator: 
        Lambda function that is triggered via CloudWatch Scheduled Event that saves a GPS coordinate and other information you can chose into a DynamoDB table.
        
    Backend: 
        API Gateway/Lambda function that reads from the DynamoDB table and returns it to the frontend.
    
    Frontend: 
        An application that plots the movement in a map in real time and shows information about an asset in a user friendly way.

* Bonus features
    
    AWS features: 
        Use of AWS IoT, Cognito, AppSync, Amplify.
    
    Frontend features: 
        Have tracking history for an asset (trace).
    
    Problem solving skill: 
        Simulator should generate GPS coordinates that are realistic (not totally random like Hornsby in one minute and then Mortdale in the next).
        
    Unit testing

* Submission
    You can sign up for a free-tier AWS account.
    Use a Github repository for your code.
    Use a README file in the repo which details how to run your project and also how you approached it and what challenges you had along the way.
    Make sure that the code you submit meets the standards you would have for a code review
    It would be great if you can send your tech test back to me within 7 days.
    Feel free to contact me if youâ€™ve any questions! Also it would be great if you can confirm that you got this email and that the task is clear :)
    
## Solution Design

    Main Task:
        [1] cloud-watch -> lambda save coords+ -> dynamo
        q: how to use IoT for better design ? which parts need to be taken ?
        
        [2] read dynamo and return to frontend
        
        [3] plot in realtime
    
    Skipped Task:
        Cognito
        AppSync

## Word Logs

- Manual prepare for valid coordinates:
    1. type name of location and add to route planner:
        [GPX](http://map.project-osrm.org/?z=12&center=38.863771%2C-76.976051&loc=38.956806%2C-77.064543&loc=38.882481%2C-77.174149&loc=38.846502%2C-77.089423&loc=38.774725%2C-77.135032&loc=38.848724%2C-76.923862&loc=38.956907%2C-77.064687&hl=en&alt=0)
    2. left down corner 'export to GPX'
    3. use sublime to quick format xml
    4. save to ./data folder
    
    Q: Assume speed < 150M/s, how much geo cords move in variation ? Can we control it ?
